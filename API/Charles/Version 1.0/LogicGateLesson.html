	<h1>Logic Gate Lesson</h1>

	<p>
		<pre>
		This will be a beginners introduction to logic gates.
	   	Logic gates have inputs and an output. The output is determined by the type of gate and the rules that apply
	   	to that gate. For this game, there will be only 2 inputs on each gate. The rules are easier to remember when
	   	they are put into a truth table. This is just a table that will list all possible inputs (A,B) and the corresponding outputs (C).
	   	
	   	<h3>OR gate</h3>
	   	RULE:	Anything or a 1 will always output a 1.
	   			The only way to ouput a 0 is when both X and Y are 0.

	   	RULE:	If anything and a 0 will always output a 0.
